# Output

Here's what the output of this project looks like: 



![Alt text](mask-detector-output.gif) 



Notes: 

1) The model outputs the text and rectangle in the color green if it detects a mask, 
yellow if the mask isn't worn correctly,
and red if it does not detect a mask.

2) Frames per seconds are low due to hardware being old.
