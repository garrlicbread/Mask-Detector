# Mask-Detector

This is a real time facemask detector built on python using MobileNetV2, OpenCv & CAFFE Res10 Model.
Primarily, this tool predicts if a person is wearing a facemask or not.
Secondly, it can tell if the person is wearing it properly. If the person isn't wearing it properly, it prompts the person to adjust it.
